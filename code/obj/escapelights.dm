// is set off by shuttle arriving on station and shuts off again when shuttle leaves
// intended for use in the middle of all main hallways to guide crew to departure
// alternates for going down the middle of 2 or 4 tile hallways or perhaps along walls
// build corners by using two of them, or intersections by using 3 or 4
// cardinal directions only

//Todo: junctions where more than one firsthalves come together get one very bright light because of overlaps
