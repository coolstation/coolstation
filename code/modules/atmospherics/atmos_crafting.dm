///Craftable atmospheric machinery
//This code of ????? quality brought to you by BatElite and probably improved on by others later

/*

CONTENTS IN ORDER OR APPEARANCE:
-Pipe frame assembly parent & code (atmos only, pipebombs are in code/obj/item/grenades.dm)
-Atmos modules
-Atmos vending machine
-Atmos crafting orientation component
-Debug atmos bapper


The basic idea here:

Pipe frames are co-opted for purpose instead of being only for pipebombs (and roller assemblies I guess, but those are kind of a novelty you remember sometimes)
I'm also kinda making the first two stages (unwelded and welded pipe frame) not a type of pipebomb assembly

Frames now cost 2 sheets (2 halves after all), and adding another sheet after welding the pipes closed branches from atmos piping into pipebombs
(so pipebombs are the same cost, but also I didn't want atmos construction to have to deal with being mostly made of half-finished pipebombs)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Pipe frame -> (weld) -> Welded pipe frame -> (sheet) -> Pipe bomb
	V							V
(mousetrap bomb)		(atmos crafting part (OPTIONAL))
	V							V
Roller assembly			Atmos construction
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A welded frame itself can be deployed into regular piping, straight or around a corner. You just weld the pipes at an angle you see :P
Stuff like pump and valve modules (from a vending machine?) can be combined to make an assembly that deploys into the appropriate thing
Also I have to say I don't really give a shit that the system lets you produce 3-way junctions from what's visibly 2 segments that's just pedantry.

Tank transfer valves aren't incorporated into this, sorry.
