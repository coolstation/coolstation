//Maintenance arrears system
//Where machines will develop problems over the round if nobody goes and check on them
//But then again they might also be Fine, so don't worry about it :3

/*
How 2 expand to other machines:
-Give that machinery type MAY_REQUIRE_MAINT in its machinery_flags
-Put some interesting behaviour in the malfuction(mult) proc, which is called during process(). Will need power to malfunction.
-If your machine doesn't call the /obj/machinery process parent, do a check for src.status & MALFUNC somewhere appropriate
-Implement a way of fixing the thing once it's malfunctioning, probably in attackby or something. Call malfunction_resolve() in that spot.
-malfunction_resolve() is also the place to override if your machine needs some kind of cleanup. Call yer parent though!
