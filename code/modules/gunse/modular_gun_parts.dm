/*
BASIC BROAD PART PARADIGMS:
" gun " : the reciever - determines whether it's single or double action, basic capacity (bolt or revolver), and DRM types
Barrels : largely handle how a shot behaves after leaving your gun. Spread, muzzle flash, silencing, damage modifiers.
Stocks  : everything to do with holding and interfacing the gun. Crankhandles, extra capacity, 2-handedness, and (on rare occasions) power cells go here
Grips	: sorry i had to break this out for logistical purposes. absolutely only used (atm) for hondling the gun, stocks are the fancy bits
Mags    : entirely optional component that adds ammo capacity, but also increases jamming frequency. May affect action type by autoloading?
accssry : mall ninja bullshit. optics. gadgets. flashlights. horns. sexy nude men figurines. your pick.
