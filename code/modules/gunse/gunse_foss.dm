// syndicate laser gun's!
// cranked capacitor which discharges through a flashtube thing and shoots a big honking lazers
// everyone else basically standardized on ammo but theirs is an open standard (that nobody uses)
// same goes for basically everything else, core foss parts only work with other core foss parts but lights and other similar attachments are fine
// nothing about this gun should be taken as applying to other gun's and vice versa
// it's basically super soaker principle
// TODO: strategy on crankin', on limits, on what different stocks allow
