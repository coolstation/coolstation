//JUICER GUN'ZES
//Loud and obnoxious and comical and deudly but also extremely unreliable
//Ammo: probably whatever but primarily shot
//Pump Action Slam
//Integrated Non-Removable TOP-FED Box Magazine (It's BIG but you still have to load one at a time and it's probably the most unreliable part)
//Ideally a two handed thing: maybe if you don't have a stock you can use wire to make a strap so it has a much smaller chance of flying out of your hands
//High damage potential but high fuckup potential as well
