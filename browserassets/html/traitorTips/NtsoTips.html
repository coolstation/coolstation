	<p> After the collapse of the channel, your unit wasn't able to make it back to Sol, and lost all contact with central
command. After the pay stopped rolling in, you and your comrades defected from the dying NT remanents and made a living off raiding the now mostly defenseless stations.
You aren't sure how long it's been since you were marooned out in the Frontier, but it's been a while.<br>
