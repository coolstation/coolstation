	<h1 class="center">You are a Free and Open Source Syndicate (FOSS) operative!</h1>
	<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/nuke-operative-image-2.png")}}" class="center" />

	<p>1. <em>Your goal</em> is to move the nuclear bomb onto the station and activate it there in the name of Free and Open Source Software.<br>
		<span class="small">The target location is recorded in the <em>audio log</em> and also viewable through the <em>Notes</em> verb.<br> If you are unsure where the target location is, check the <em>map</em> button in the top right of the client, or use the <em>camera monitors</em> on the bridge.</span></p>

	<p class="image-right">2. Each operative can visit the armory to customise their gun, and to load up on other goodies.</em><br>
		<span class="small">The GNU/Battleship contains a variety of goods too, so be sure to look around.<br>
		It is often worthwhile to plan your loadout with your fellow operatives!</span></p>

	<p>3. Optionally, the captain's <em>authentication disk</em> can be used to shorten the countdown. The Syndicate commander spawns with a special version of the pinpointer that tracks the disk instead of the nuclear bomb.</p>

	<p>4. Teamplay is key! <em>Discuss the mission</em> with your comrades and come up with a solid plan <em>before</em> anybody heads out. Use your headset to stay in touch:<br><br>
	   <span class="small">say :h I'm about to activate the nuke in security. Stick together, boys!</span></p>

	<p>5. To exit the GNU/Battleship, take a pod from the podbay and open a wormhole leading to the station. Be aware that Pods <em>cannot warp back</em> to the GNU/Battleship.<br>
	      <span class="small">Alternatively, stand on the <em>teleporter pad</em> and use your <em>teleporter remote</em>. This will take you to the listening post. You return to the shuttle in the same way.</span></p>

	<p class="image-right">6. To trigger the nuke:<br>
		<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/nuke-2.png")}}" class="right" />
		<span class="small indent">
			1. Load the nuke into one of your pods and drop it off near the station.<br>
			2. Move the nuke to the designated area.<br>
			3. Click on the nuke with an empty hand to activate it. That will prompt a station-wide red alert, stating your exact location.<br>
			4. Insert the authentication disk if you have it.<br>
			5. Defend the nuke until the countdown reaches zero. It's all or nothing!<br>
			6. Declare the superiority of OpenDWAINE and vanish in a cloud of radioactive fire!<br>
