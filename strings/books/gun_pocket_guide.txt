		<h2>HOW TO BE A GUNSMITH</h2>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<h3>BUY AND SELL GUNS CASH MONEY</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		This one is incredibly self-explanatory. You see stuff you like, pay some money for it. You can sell it to some other schmuck who wants to pimp their gun out. DO NOT HESITATE to buy and sell contraband, stolen goods, whatever. Guns are guns and you're the gunsmith- your poor mark doesnt need to know their shit's getting confiscated, and employee asset forfeiture keeps budgets in the green.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>MAKE AND BREAK GUNS</h3>
		<br>
		This is the meat of the job. <br>
		Located in your Gunnery's Broomcloset, and in a few other places, is a Gunsmithing Anvil. This is the only tool you need to build, modify, or strip a gun for parts.
		<br><br>
		<b> STEP ONE: BREAKING</b><br>
		To take a gun apart, just hold it in you hands and bash it against the anvil. It might take several hits to dislodge the twist-locks that hold everything in place, so be violent about it!
		<br>
		Then you'll have a pile of gun parts, along with the reciever. You can sell parts individually, or use them to build cooler guns.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b> STEP TWO: MAKING</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		Assembling a gun is simple. Every gun is composed of one reciever, and up to 5 gun parts, though you'll probably need at least two to make anything functional.
		<br>
		Those parts are:<br>
		- A Barrel (necessary)<br>
		- One or two Stocks or Grips (necessary)<br>
		- A magazine (optional)<br>
		- An Accessory (optional)<br>
		<br>
		Simply hit the reciever with a part to place it into the assembly loosely. The gun won't function in this state, and you can swap out parts by simply adding another of the same type.
		<br> Different gun parts have different properties, including modifiers to accuracy, 1-or-2-handedness, projectile power, alternative functions, and ammo capacity. You can see these properties in the tooltips that appear when you hover your mouse over them.
		<br>
		<br>
		When you're satisfied with the parts on your gun, you can lock them into place by again bashing the gun against the Gunsmithing Anvil until everything looks good.
		<br> You can now examine the finished stats of your gun by examining the tooltip.

		<h3>ROOT AND SHOOT GUNS</h3>
		<br>
		Gun's Systen (that's what this modular gun bullshit is called) functions slightly differently than most weapons you may have seen outside the frontier.
		<br> Nanotrasen's standard issue sidearms are either single-shot muzzle-loading pistols, or bolt-action breech-loading rifles. This means reloading is a frequent affair, and in the case of repeating rifles, cycling ammunition is a must.
		<br> If your gun is equipped with an ammo hold, you can cycle the chamber by pressing the <b>C (use-in-hand) hotkey</b> or clicking the gun with it in your active hand.
		<br> Other guns on the frontier may provide automatic ammunition cycling, or function in entirely novel and open-sourced ways. Get out and experiment.
		<br> Jams, empty breeches, and most other no-fire conditions can usually be cleared with the same C hotkey.
		<br> When it's time to reload, just hit a box of ammunition with your gun, or vice versa, and let the abstraction whisk you away:)
		<br><br>
		That's it, that's Gun's Systen!
