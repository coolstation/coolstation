<b><font face=Georgia color=black size='3'>THE CHANNEL ANOMALY: A FRANK AND HONEST ASSESSMENT</b><br>
<br>
<br>
You are no doubt familiar with the events of 2047. A flash in the Channel, an ejection of material, a shockwave issuing forth from its endpoint. 
<br>
<br>
The Channel became impassible, the lines fell silent, and everything went dark.
<br>
<br>
All transportation between Earth and the Frontier has been disrupted. Unfortunately, we are unable to relieve any current employees stationed Frontierside, but salaries will continue to be paid out of our budget reserves, calculated against expenses.
<br>
<br>
While the stationary relay platforms within the channel are unreachable, a low bandwidth emergency communication system is still operational.
<br>
<br>
Despite claims to the contrary by corporate saboteurs and other malcontents, contact with Earth has not been completely severed and is being reserved for the most critical communications.
<br>
<br>
The good news is that Frontierside Nanotrasen has absolutely no involvement with this event or its aftermath, and is continuing to pursue criminal investigations in accordance with (tree law).
<br>
<br>
Nanotrasen, here and beyond, is working tirelessly to restore the Channel to operation. In the meantime, its corporate edicts are clear:
<br>
<br>
Uphold relevant Terrestrial and NT law, enforce the respect of copyright and patents and, above all else, ensure business continuity until resumption of regular Earthside headquarters contact and logistical transport shuttles.
<br>
<br>
Luckily, all necessary resources are available Frontierside to maintain the current station flotilla and secondary sites and operations are currently completely unaffected.
<br>
<br>
The minor upheaval and occasional violence in the three years post-closure have obviously been quelled, and station repair techniques have advanced significantly as a result.
<br>
<br>
Morale is high, productivity has not suffered, and the only significant threats are of patent infringement. This is a storm that all of us at Nanotrasen will be able to ride out, together.
<br>
<br>
Soon, Nanotrasen will be reunited through its combined Earthside and Frontierside efforts. Soon, business as normal will resume. Soon, you may return home.
<br>
<br>
You have this as our promise, for our bright and rapidly approaching future.
