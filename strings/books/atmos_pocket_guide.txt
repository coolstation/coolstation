		Plumbing, pipelaying, gasworks, tubesmanship. <br>
		There are many names for our sacred and holy trade. <br>
		That's it that's the Introduction.<br><br><hr><br>

		<h3> Atmospheric Plumbing</h3>
		<p>Plumbing for atmospherics is slightly more complicated than plumbing for disposals but you'll figure it out, champ.
		<li> I'm sure of it.
		<li> Everything starts with a Pipe Frame. Hold some sheets of metal in your hand, and with all of our might,
		<li> roll that shit into a tube. Just by hand. Trust me.
		<li> Weld the seam shut with a handheld welding tool and you're good to go.
		<li> Now you can use that thing in your hand, figure out which direction you want to lay it down, and then lay it on the floor.
		<li> No further installation required.
		<li>
		<li> How about if you want something a little more complicated? There's a vending machine that dispenses Atmospherics Modules.
		<li> These are half-finished units youll need to combine with a welded pipe frame to complete.
		<li> Add a module to a pipe frame, or a pipe fram to a module, and just like the pipes, lay them on the floor. It might take practice.
		<li> But like I said champ, you'll get the hang of it.
		<hr>
		<li> Oh you want to take it apart now? You fucker. You bastard. All my hard work for nothing???
		<li> Fine.
		<li> Hold in one hand a lit welding tool, and in the other hand a deconstruction device. You animal.
		<li> Use one or the other on my beautiful gasworks, and despair.

		<h3> Disposal Plumbing</h3>
		<br> todo. Nobody cares.
