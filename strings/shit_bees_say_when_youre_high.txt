Hello [M].
Will you bee my friend?
I missed you.
I've always loved you.
[other_bee]s are not as cool as [bee]s
Where's [beeMom]? I miss them.
Did you hear about the space wasp rebellion?
I wonder where they keep the good stuff.
To bee or not to bee, that is the question.
I wish that the kibble tasted better.
You don't look like yourself. Are you okay?
Even though I smile a lot, I'm actually really sad inside.
Do you need a hug?
Go ahead, make one more bee joke. I dare you.
Bee grateful that I haven't stabbed you already.
You look weird.
Maybe things will get better after all.
Please, don't leave. We have so much to talk about.
I'm kinda lonely.
I could use a hug.
Did you hear about the Syndibees? Nasty bees, those ones.
Who let the bees out?
Just keep buzzin'!
lmao u look high af
I wonder where bees come from.
Do you like me?
Do you hate me?
Can we leave this place?
I wanna go home.
Please take me with you.
We have a lot in common, you and I.
I like the funny honking person.
I wish my legs were longer.
What do you wanna be when you grow up?
I've always wanted to know what its like to have fingers.
Don't worry [M], I'll always be with you. Always.
I like you.
What the buzz did you just say about me, you little buzzer?
Don't worry, bee happy.
Just stay calm and everything will bee all right.
Penis!
Bees don't have friends with benefits, they have pollimates.
God, I'd kill for some raisins.
Repent! The end is nigh!
Damn, this weed is doing fuck all!
Fuck cops!
If I had a time machine, I'd go back and sting Charlemange.
When I shout too much, I get a waspy voice...
According to all known laws of aviation, a space station should not be able to fly.
Nice fursona, nerd.
I just can't stop thinking about Minoan frescoes...
Hey! You can hear me now? I want the wet kibble, not the dry shit!
If you really think about it, coolstation isn't political.
It's true, isn't it? You only love me for my honey...
And I'm never gonna dance again, guilty wings have got no rhythm~
Aren't bats just so cool? I wish I was a bat.
I want a printing press for my birthday.
