A utility for generating DM code for directed_broadcast datums

The 'scrungle' button generates the code and copies it to your clipboard

The 'New' button in the 'File' drop down will wipe everything and start a new
broadcast. Do not hit this unless you really want to start over.

The .broad files are just JSON files with a unique file extension
